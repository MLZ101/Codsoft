                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, led a remarkable life filled with
                    triumphs and challenges. He emerged as a transcendent figure, not just for his boxing prowess, but
                    also for his charismatic persona and steadfast principles. <br> <br> claimed a gold medal at the
                    1960
                    Olympics and went on to become the world heavyweight champion, notably toppling Sonny Liston in
                    1964. Ali's refusal to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, grounded in his
                    religious convictions and opposition to the conflict, led to his suspension from boxing and a
                    protracted legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court.<br> <br>After this tumultuous period,
                    Ali
                    reclaimed his title and engaged in iconic bouts like the "Rumble in the Jungle" and the "Thrilla in
                    Manila." <br> <br>Alongside his athletic feats, Ali faced personal struggles such as being diagnosed
                    with
                    Parkinson's disease, likely stemming from his years in the ring. Despite this challenge, he
                    continued to be an advocate for social justice, civil rights, and humanitarian causes. His powerful
                    messages of unity, self-confidence, and his dedication to these principles left an enduring impact.
                    <br><br>
                    Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, leaving behind a legacy that encompasses not only his
                    athletic achievements but also his resilience in the face of adversity and his unwavering commitment
                    to making the world a better place.

                <h2>A Boxing Icon</h2>
                <p>Muhammad Ali's boxing odyssey is a saga of triumphs, obstacles, and an unrivaled influence on the
                    sport. Ali's Olympic gold in 1960 foreshadowed the
                    brilliance to come. As a professional, his nimble footwork, blinding jabs, and unconventional style
                    rewrote the heavyweight boxing narrative. The seismic upset over Sonny Liston in 1964 launched his
                    meteoric ascent, accompanied by his bold declaration, "I am the greatest." <br> <br>

                    Ali's audacious conversion to Islam and principled stance against the Vietnam War suspended his
                    career, yet his 1970 return marked a phoenix-like revival. The clashes with Joe Frazier, notably the
                    "Fight of the Century" in 1971 and the iconic "Thrilla in Manila" in 1975, etched themselves into
                    legend. His tactical brilliance was on full display in the "Rumble in the Jungle," employing the
                    rope-a-dope tactic to dismantle George Foreman in 1974. <br> <br>

                    Ali's training regimen, an amalgam of innovation and tradition, included his renowned rope-jumping
                    routines for stamina and intense sparring sessions for speed. His pre-fight psychological warfare
                    was as compelling as his physical prowess; he once proclaimed, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a
                    bee. The hands can't hit what the eyes can't see." His interviews danced with poetry and
                    braggadocio, amplifying his mystique and setting the stage for his bouts as much outside the ring as
                    within. <br> <br>

                    With a record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37 knockouts, Ali's legacy is cemented. His style, an artful
                    fusion of athleticism and spectacle, mesmerized audiences. Muhammad Ali's preparation, magnetic
                    interviews, and steadfast commitment to his beliefs carved an indelible niche, ensuring his status
                    as a lodestar in boxing annals and beyond.</p>

                <h2>A Legend On and Off the Ring</h2>
                <p>Muhammad Ali's impact stretched far beyond the boxing arena, as he used his voice and actions to
                    champion civil rights, racial equality, and humanitarian causes. Ali's conversion to Islam and name
                    change symbolized his commitment to principles
                    that extended beyond sport. <br> <br>

                    His stance against the Vietnam War was a watershed moment. Ali famously stated, "I ain't got no
                    quarrel with them Viet Cong," expressing his opposition to the conflict. His bold refusal to be
                    drafted led to his suspension from boxing and his enduring words: "I will not disgrace my religion,
                    my people or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice,
                    freedom and equality." <br> <br>

                    Ali's activism continued with his vocal support for the Nation of Islam and racial justice. He said,
                    "I am America. I am the part you won't recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky; my
                    name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own; get used to me." His refusal to perform
                    in racially segregated states and his calls for unity reverberated powerfully. <br> <br>

                    In terms of humanitarian efforts, Ali's role as a UNICEF ambassador demonstrated his global outlook.
                    His dedication to charitable causes was palpable, as seen in his words: "Service to others is the
                    rent you pay for your room here on Earth." Despite his battle with Parkinson's disease, he remained
                    steadfast, showing that his fight extended beyond the boxing ring. <br> <br>

                    Muhammad Ali's legacy melds with his unwavering commitment to justice. His words, actions, and
                    speeches like "I am the greatest, I said that even before I knew I was," remain a testament to his
                    enduring impact, resonating as a call to champion change and equality.</p>
